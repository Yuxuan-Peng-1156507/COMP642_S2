# Fresh Harvest Veggies - README

This project is a user interface created using Flask, focusing on building an e-commerce platform for fresh produce delivery. 
## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Create the Database**
   Create a database named `fresh_harvest`.

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS fresh_harvest;
   USE fresh_harvest;
   
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       address VARCHAR(255),
       account_balance FLOAT,
       created_at DATETIME
   );
   
   -- Include similar CREATE TABLE commands for other tables
   ```

### 2. **Insert Initial Data**
   Run `insert_data.py`. This script creates the necessary tables and inserts initial data into the database, including customers, staff members, vegetables, and premade boxes.

### 3. **Testing**
   `test_models.py` is a script designed to test the model objects and their functionality. It will help you verify if the database was created successfully. Run the test using the following terminal command:

   ```sh
   pytest tests/test_models.py
   pytest tests/test_app.py

   ```
### 4. **Run the Application**
   After verifying the database setup, run `app.py` to start the application:

   ```sh
   flask run
   ```

   You can then access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
